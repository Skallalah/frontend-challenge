# AnalyzerApp

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 8.3.8.

## Goal

> The objective is to implement a simple data visualization application that must display the evolution of the online demand for a given selection of keywords (ie. the search volume).

## How to launch the application

Once you have cloned the project, run the command `npm install` in the `analyzer-app/` directory to install all the dependencies needed for the project, then either run a development server, or build and deploy the application on one of your server (see below).

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `--prod` flag for a production build.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via [Protractor](http://www.protractortest.org/).
